These functions show how to generate ground truth visual motion estimates taking into account camera calibration parameters.

Camera calibration for DVS cameras is done using code from 
http://www.garrickorchard.com/code

which in turn relies heavily on the Caltech Camera Calibration Toolbox, available from 
www.vision.caltech.edu/bouguetj/calib_doc/

The script 'example.m' shows how to use the functions.
